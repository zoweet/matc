My name is Zoe Taylor. I will be a senior next year at American Fork High School. This is the source code to projects I have done in my classes. So far I have focused mainly on Java development because those are the classes taught at American Fork High School. A good example of my programming skills would be the Tic-Tac-Toe game I created here...

I have been taking only courses from different websites. I have recently completed the Angular.js course at Code School and have completed several courses on HTML and CSS at Code Academy. Below are screenshots of my completion certificates so far.
